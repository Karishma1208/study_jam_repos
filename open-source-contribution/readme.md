# Open Source Contribution

It's never been easy to learn programming. But despite tons of ways to learn how to code, we believe that the best way to improve your skills is by contributing to **open source projects**.

The open source community provides a great opportunity for aspiring programmers to distinguish themselves; and by contributing to various projects, developers can improve their skills and get inspiration and support from like-minded people. But most importantly, they can prove that they can build fantastic experiences that people love.

### How can I start?

You can start right with us. We have created the design for you to build a dummy project. You can find the design in the `.pdf` file we have added to this repository.

- Fork this repository. If you don't have a GitHub account, create one.
- Clone this repo on your machine.
- You'd find a folder with the name `open_source_contribution/`
- Create a folder with your name inside the folder `open_source_contribution/`. For example, `rahul_shetty/`
- Create a `index.html`, `style.css`, `index.js` file inside the folder you just created.
- You have to build an app for calculating the share expected from each person on the basis of the total amount. The design itself is quite self explanatory.
- Submit the request to merge.
- VOILA!
